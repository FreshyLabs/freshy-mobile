# Frehys Mobile UI w/Cordova 

Cordova lets us build for any mobile platform like IOS and Andriod and get the app deployed to the various app stores. 

To run this app: 

  ```
    sudo npm install -g cordova
    sudo npm install -g ios-sim
    cd app
    cordova emulate ios 
  ```

To develop, make changes then re-build it

  ```
    cordova build
    cordova emulate ios 
  ```
